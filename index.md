# Get started

SpaceHosting is a service for finding k-nearest neighbors ( kNN) using a .NET library [SpaceHosting.Index](https://github.com/kontur-model-ops/space-hosting-index#spacehostingindex). 

Dense and sparse vectors are supported. For dense vectors we use [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) native library. For sparse vectors we have ported [PySparNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pysparnn) library to C#. 

## Why SpaceHosting? 

SpaceHosting advantages: 
* Supports dense and sparse vectors.
* Uses search algorithms:
  * Faiss.
  * Ported PySparNN.
* Supports Approximate kNN (AkNN).

## SpaceHosting.Index library

SpaceHosting.Index keeps a mapping between vectors and a set of keys. При поиске kNN/AkNN eturns keys instead of vector numbers. A key is a set of parameters that identifies a vector. 

The library also allows to keep any metadata alongside corresponding vectors. kNN/AkNN search results contain metadata as well as vectors.
